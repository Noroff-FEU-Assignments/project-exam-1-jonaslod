## Description

The brief in Project Exam 1 was to create a personal blog. I chose to create a blog about books. The idea was that the blog was a space where I could share my thoughts about the different books Iâ€™ve read, and invite discussion from visiting users. The blog consists of 5 pages:
- A home page with a carousel showing the latest posts uploaded to the blog.
- A list of posts page where users can view all posts or search through the posts, using an input for text, checkboxes for categories and radio buttons for sorting by new/old.
- A post specific page which is dynamically built based on which post the user selected. The user can also read/post comments under each post, which (if something is written) will be posted to the WordPress API.
- An about page detailing the goal and history of the blog.
- A contact page where the user can submit a form (if all fields are valid) to the API.

## Built With
The project was created using HTML, CSS and JavaScript and includes a headless WordPress API used for storing blog posts.

## Getting Started
The project does not contain any dependencies, and can easily be installed/run by cloning the GitHub repo.
```
git clone https://github.com/Noroff-FEU-Assignments/project-exam-1-jonaslod.git
```

## Contributing
If you wish to contribute by sending in feedback, you are welcome to do so. I am relatively new to front-end development, and I am sure there are many improvements to be made. You are also able to submit code to the project, since the project is uploaded on a public GitHub repository. If you want to do so, be sure to open a pull request so the code can be reviewed.
